X = summary stat (hill number)
X = genetic diversity
X = vector quantity (abundanceSp, traitsIndv, traitsSp)
X = mean of vector quantity
X = individual quantity (number of branches in phylogeny) 
X = phylo (a whole phylogenetic tree - can't get mean phylo however) 
Z = mean
Z = max
Z = min
Z = range  

get a series of X over time for a single model
get an Z series of X over time for multiple models

Y = prior
Y = iterfunc

sample parameters in runtime using a Y and save it with the object

label models within an experiment (i.e. first 5 have a climatic shift resulting in a new trait optimum)
